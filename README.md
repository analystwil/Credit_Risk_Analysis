# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
I used Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. I used imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. The data used in this analysis is a credit card dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. I oversampled the data using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, I compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. To complete the analysis I evaluated the performance of these models and made a reccomendation on whether these models should be used to predict credit risk.
